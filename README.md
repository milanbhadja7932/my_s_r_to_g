# rgb-to-gray

# problem statement
     -> Develop a neural net to convert RGB image into a grayscale image.
     
# Overview

    We have a lots of images in which regular image is convert into gray which is more useful for us.
    tensorflow have a library for convert images is <b>tf.image.rgb_to_grayscale</b> and 
    opencv have also library for this <b>cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
</b>.

# Requirements

1-Tensorflow
2-Numpy
3-Opencv
4-matplotlib

# Convert images from rgb to gray scale
  
  we have to convert image into gray scale means remove the color like red,blue and greeen. our final goal is convert images into gray scale.
  
# Input Images
   
   As a example we pass any image which photo is below here.
   
# Output Images
   As a output we get the Images in Gray scale.
